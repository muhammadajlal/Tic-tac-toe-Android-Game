# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description

The Tic Tac Toe Game is a 2D game developed in Android Studio using Java and XML. It is a two-player turn-based game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with either X or O, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The game ends when all squares are filled or one player gets three in a row. If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is considered a draw. The game also has a reset button to start a new game.
